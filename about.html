        <p>Learn more about our church, our mission, and our community.</p>
         <h2>Bishop Dag Heward-Mills</h2>
        <p>Dag Heward-Mills, a Healing Evangelist is the founder and presiding bishop of the United Denominations Originating from the Lighthouse Group of Churches (UD-OLGC, formerly Lighthouse Chapel International). A qualified medical doctor, Dag gave himself wholly to the work of God in 1991 and has never looked back. Dag Heward-Mills has a multifarious ministry that has transformed and continues to impact millions of lives across the globe..</p>
        <p>The UD-OLGC has a presence in 94 countries and on all habitable continents. In over three decades of ministry, Dag Heward-Mills’ passion for God’s work has been characterized by building churches, training pastors, helping the needy and invalid, authoring, producing music, speaking at conferences, pastoring young people, and holding massive evangelistic campaigns in many nations.</p>
        <p>He has been welcomed by many presidents, chiefs, and leaders of nations, and has personally led several of them to Christ. Dag Heward-Mills is greatly admired for his candid and down-to-earth teaching and writing style.</p>
         <h2>Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Dag was born to Swiss mother Elisabeth and Ghanaian father Nathaniel Heward-Mills on May 14th, 1963. During his younger years, Dag enjoyed horse-riding and hanging out with friends.</p>
        <p>Dag gave his life to Christ when he was about sixteen years old and under diligent mentorship, grew in the faith during his high school and university years.</p>
        <p>He became a pastor at the age of twenty-five and was later formally ordained by Pastor Michael Bassett of the Victory Church in London, and subsequently consecrated as a Bishop by the International Ministerial Council of Great Britain..</p>
        <h2>“From today, you can teach…”</h2>
        <p>In 1988, during his final year of medical school, Dag was on a community health rotation program in a town called Suhum. Dag Heward-Mills (then Brother Dag) was praying in his room on his knees and resting his head on his bed, when he fell asleep.</p>
        <p>He had left a message preached by Kenneth Hagin playing on repeat.</p>
        <p>Dag later recounts, “At about 3 a.m., I was kneeling by the bed praying. I could see the tape recorder situated at the other end of the room. Then suddenly, something literally jumped out of the tape which was playing and moved into my belly.</p>
        <p>I could feel it entering me. Then I heard a voice saying, “From today, you can teach.” Then I heard another voice, different to the first, that said, “I will prove it to you”. Upon his return to the church in Accra, Dag’s ministry began to change.</p>
        <p>Today, we witness the tangible effects and undeniable proof of God’s calling on Bishop Dag Heward Mills’ life and the supernatural power behind those words, “From today, you can teach”.</p>
        <h2>Anagkazo Bible & Ministry Training Center</h2>
        <p>A significant part of Dag Heward-Mills’ ministry involves the training and nurturing of pastors.

Many alumni of ABMTC have been known to advance far in ministry and build large churches.</p>
        <p>The campus also houses the Center for Historical Research into World Evangelism and Global Mission, (CHRIWEGM) also know as “Library Of The Anointing”, a museum which features life-sized effigies of prominent men of God from different times in history.</p>
        <h2>Conference Speaker</h2>
        <p>Dag Heward-Mills holds the Give Thyself Wholly Conference several times a year, in different countries of the world, where he teaches and trains pastors and church- workers for many hours on subjects such as Loyalty & Disloyalty, Church Growth, Shepherding, The Art of Leadership, and The Anointing.</p>
        <p>There are a plethora of testimonies of senior pastors, assistant pastors, church leaders, and church workers whose lives and ministries have been transformed by attending these conferences.</p>
        
         <h2Church Planting Ministry</h2>

             <h2>Healing Evangelist</h2>
             <p>The Healing Jesus Campaign initiative spearheaded by Evangelist Dag Heward-Mills is an international evangelistic outreach that holds large open-air campaigns in cities, towns, and villages across nations.</p>
             <p>During these campaigns, Evangelist Dag preaches the gospel to many thousands of people and prays for the sick. Free salvation books are distributed, and during many of the campaigns, the locals receive free medical care from medical professionals under the Healing Jesus medical missions initiative.</p>
             <p>By the grace of God, these campaigns are replete with signs and wonders: the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and many medical complications including cancer disappear.</p>
             <p>Through the Healing Jesus Campaign initiative, nearly 12 million people all over the world have received Jesus Christ into their hearts. Several campaigns are held in different countries every year.</p>

             <p>A few years ago, the Lord instructed Dag to “go back to his first love”, and Dag immediately took a radical decision to hand over the large denomination he had founded and move to a university campus to pastor young people.</p>
